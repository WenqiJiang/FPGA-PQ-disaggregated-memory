# CPU Programs

The host CPU program that sits between FPGAs and potentially GPUs for RALM. 

## CPU_to_FPGA: the host program

It has complex arguments. To make the program run easier, use the `launch_CPU_and_FPGA.py` script for starting the CPU program and/or the FPGA simulator. 

## TODO

* Add HNSW plugin
* Add real data gathering in multi-thread CPP
* Save profile information
